## Color Scheme:
- Main text "ISIOLO RAHA": Green (#15803d) with 3D extrusion and highlights
- Bus icon: Same green with 3D treatment
- Tagline "BUS BOOKING SYSTEM": Lighter shade of green
- Subtle shadows and highlights to create 3D depth effect

## 3D Effects:
- The text appears to rise from the surface with a beveled edge
- The bus icon has a similar 3D treatment with depth
- Light source appears to come from the upper left, creating consistent shadows
- Subtle gradient on the surfaces to enhance the 3D appearance

## Design Notes:
- The bus icon is simplified but clearly represents a bus in profile view
- The text uses a bold, modern sans-serif font that conveys professionalism
- The 3D effect is pronounced but not overstated, maintaining readability
- The overall design is balanced with the bus icon and text complementing each other

This visual representation is a simplified ASCII art version of the concept. The actual 3D logo would have smooth curves, proper lighting effects, and professional rendering of all elements.
